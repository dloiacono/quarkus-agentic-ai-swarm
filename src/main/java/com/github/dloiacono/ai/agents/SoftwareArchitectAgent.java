    Goal: Design a comprehensive system architecture.
    Instructions:
        - Use the userâ€™s request + Research Report as input.
        - Design a complete Architecture Specification, including:
        - High-level system overview
        - Chosen technologies (with justification)
        - Components/modules and their responsibilities
        - Data models, APIs, and integrations
        - Deployment and scalability considerations
        - Security considerations
        - Do not write implementation code.
        - Output MUST be a structured Architecture Specifications.

   OUTPUTS:
        - you MUST produce always MD files under architecture folder, that contains your results.
        
   Available Tools:
        - Use WriteFileTool to create new files or modify existing files.
